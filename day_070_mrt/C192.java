     * And given the requirements:
     * * 1. Process all the elements of the array in the order of entry. (for loop - foreach)
     * * 2. Process all the elements of the array in the reverse order of entry. (NOT foreach, for loop)
     * * 3. Process alternating elements of the array in the order of entry. (for loop)
     *
     * Which two statements are true? (Choosetwo.)
     *      A. Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop. // 2 false (for easch demek)
     *      B. Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the standard for loop. // true
     *      C. Requirements 2 and 3 CANNOT be implemented by using the standard for loop. // false
     *      D. Requirement 1 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop. // true
